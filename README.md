# Diabetes-Classificatio

I have done Data cleaning , pre-processing, and wrangling , I have compared several techniques like logistic regression, linear regression,SVM,Random forest and decision tree.
I found out that RF gives the best accuracy among these and we have also use train-split to cross validate our paramerters and the accuracy is about 95%.
